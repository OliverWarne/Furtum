# Furtum
A fun reddit bot that gets karma via reposting comments Trapped_in_Reddit style.

## Usage

Using Furtum is generally pretty simple. You can leave it by itself for a while, and it shouldn't crash (for a while). If it does, message me with the error that it spits out and I'll try to fix it

Occasionally, it's mess up and post the wrong stuff. I think it's [hilarious](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/36l5f5/thug_life/), so I don't intend to fix it. 

#### Setting up
You need [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.org/en/v2.1.21/) and [KD'api'](https://github.com/ethanhjennings/karmadecay-api) Place the KDapi folder in the same directory as furtum.py and config.py.

Go through config.py and fill out everything.

#### Running
Once you have set everything up, just run furtum.py. It'll give you updates on what it's doing.
